# Create_WARC_files

The Jupyter notebook found in this repository gives a detailed introduction on the Web ARChive (WARC) file format. The WARC format represents the unique ISO standard format for archiving webdata. Code snippets show how to red and write .warc files using the Python module warcio. Applications on both live websites as well as archived websites from the Internet Archive and Common Crawl can be found in the notebook.
